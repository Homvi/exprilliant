# Exprilliant Project Review & Todo

## Project Overview
Exprilliant is a well-structured Laravel + React application for learning expressions and idioms. The project uses modern technologies including Laravel 10, Inertia.js, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and DaisyUI. It's a passion project with good architectural foundations but has several areas for improvement.

## Strengths âœ…

1. **Modern Tech Stack**: Uses current versions of Laravel, React, TypeScript, and Vite
2. **Good Architecture**: Proper separation of concerns with MVC pattern
3. **Internationalization**: Multi-language support with JSON-based localization
4. **Type Safety**: TypeScript implementation with proper type definitions
5. **Modern Frontend**: React with Zustand for state management
6. **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI components
7. **Testing Setup**: Pest PHP testing framework and Playwright for e2e tests
8. **Code Quality**: ESLint and Prettier configuration

## Specific Code Issues Found

### Backend Issues
1. **ExpressionController.php**: Too many responsibilities, needs splitting
2. **User.php**: Hardcoded admin email is a security risk
3. **Missing validation**: No comprehensive input validation
4. **No error handling**: Missing try-catch blocks in critical operations

### Frontend Issues
1. **TypeScript configuration**: Could be stricter
2. **Component organization**: Some components are too large
3. **State management**: Stores could be better organized
4. **Error handling**: Missing error boundaries

### Database Issues
1. **Missing indexes**: No indexes on frequently queried columns
2. **No soft deletes**: Hard deletes could cause data loss
3. **Missing constraints**: No foreign key constraints
4. **No transactions**: Critical operations not wrapped in transactions

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**: Fix security issues and add proper validation
2. **Short Term**: Refactor code for better maintainability
3. **Medium Term**: Add comprehensive testing and performance optimizations
4. **Long Term**: Implement advanced features like offline support and real-time updates
